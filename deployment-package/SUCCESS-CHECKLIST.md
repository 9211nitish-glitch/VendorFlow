# ✅ StarsFlock.in Deployment Success Checklist

## Current Status: Server Starting Successfully

Based on the logs, your Node.js server is now starting correctly:
- ✅ npm install completed without errors
- ✅ Server is starting with proper directory path
- ✅ No more nodenv or npm dependency issues

## Next Steps to Complete Deployment

### 1. Check Server Status
The server should now be listening on port 5000. Check if you can see this in the Plesk logs:
```
✅ StarsFlock.in server running on port 5000
🌐 Website: http://localhost:5000
🔧 API Health: http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

### 2. Test Your Website
Try accessing these URLs:
- **Main Website**: `http://starsflock.in`
- **Health Check**: `http://starsflock.in/api/health`

### 3. Expected Results

**If Successful:**
- Main website loads your React application
- Health check shows JSON response: `{"status":"OK","message":"StarsFlock.in is running successfully!"}`
- No more 503 Service Unavailable errors

**If Still Having Issues:**
- Check Plesk Node.js panel shows "Running" status
- Verify Document Root is `/httpdocs/backend`
- Verify Application Startup File is `server.js`

### 4. What's Working Now

**Current Features:**
- ✅ Basic Node.js server (no external dependencies)
- ✅ Serves your React frontend files
- ✅ API endpoint structure ready
- ✅ CORS handling for frontend communication
- ✅ SPA routing support for React Router
- ✅ Health check endpoint

**Next Phase (After Basic Site Works):**
- Database integration
- User authentication
- Full task management features
- Payment processing

## File Structure Verification

Your current structure should be:
```
/httpdocs/
├── backend/
│   ├── server.js     ← Ultra-simple Node.js server
│   └── package.json  ← Minimal config
├── index.html        ← Your React app entry point
├── assets/          ← CSS and JS files
│   ├── index-*.css
│   └── index-*.js
└── uploads/         ← User uploads folder
```

The server is designed to serve your React app from the root while handling API requests through the `/api/` prefix.
