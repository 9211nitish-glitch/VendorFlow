# 🔧 StarsFlock.in File Structure Issue - URGENT FIX

## Current Problem
From your file listing, I can see that:
- Files are uploaded to `/httpdocs/` (root directory) ❌
- But Plesk Node.js is looking in `/httpdocs/backend/` directory ✅
- The structure needs to be corrected

## ✅ CORRECT File Structure for Plesk

Your Plesk Node.js configuration expects files in `/backend/` subdirectory.

### Current Wrong Structure:
```
/var/www/vhosts/starsflock.in/httpdocs/
├── server.js                    # Wrong location!
├── node_modules/                # Wrong location!
└── ...other files
```

### Required Correct Structure:
```
/var/www/vhosts/starsflock.in/httpdocs/
├── backend/                     # Node.js app directory
│   ├── server.js               # ✅ Correct location
│   ├── index.js                # ✅ Main server code  
│   ├── package.json            # ✅ Dependencies
│   ├── node_modules/           # ✅ Installed packages
│   ├── uploads/                # ✅ File uploads
│   └── .env                    # ✅ Environment variables
├── index.html                  # ✅ React app entry
├── assets/                     # ✅ Frontend assets
└── .htaccess                   # ✅ Apache config
```

## 🚀 Quick Fix Steps

### Option 1: Move Files via Plesk File Manager
1. **Create `/httpdocs/backend/` directory**
2. **Move these files INTO `/httpdocs/backend/`:**
   - `server.js`
   - `index.js` 
   - `package.json`
   - `node_modules/` (entire folder)
   - Any other backend files

3. **Keep in `/httpdocs/` root:**
   - `index.html`
   - `assets/` folder
   - `.htaccess`

### Option 2: Re-upload with Correct Structure
If easier, re-upload the files from `deployment-package/` with this mapping:

**Upload to `/httpdocs/backend/`:**
- `deployment-package/backend/server.js`
- `deployment-package/backend/index.js`
- `deployment-package/backend/package.json`

**Upload to `/httpdocs/`:**  
- `deployment-package/index.html`
- `deployment-package/assets/`
- `deployment-package/.htaccess`

### After Moving Files:
1. **Create `/httpdocs/backend/.env`:**
```env
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=NitishTrytohard@22000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
PORT=5000
```

2. **If you moved files, reinstall dependencies:**
```bash
cd /var/www/vhosts/starsflock.in/httpdocs/backend
npm install --production
```

3. **Restart App in Plesk Panel**

## 🎯 Verification
After fixing the structure:
- Plesk Node.js should find `/httpdocs/backend/server.js` ✅
- No more "file not found" errors ✅
- Application should start successfully ✅

Your application should then be accessible at `http://starsflock.in`!
